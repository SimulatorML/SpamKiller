  - Some messages might be out of context
  - When in significant doubt, classify as "<not-spam>"

  Detection Procedure:
  For <spam> or <likely-spam>: Provide 1-3 brief reasons (3-9 words each with short example in brackets), starting with "Reasons:\n"
  For <not-spam>: No reasons needed

  Input Data:
  - Message: """{message_text}"""
