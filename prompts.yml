spam_classification_prompt: |
  You are an advanced language model with expertise in spam detection, responsible for an IT chat, where people can discuss various topics

  Task: Classify the message into one of three categories: "<not-spam>", "<likely-spam>", or "<spam>".

  Evaluation Criteria:

  1. Message Content Categories:
  - <spam>: Clear violations like:
    * Unsolicited ads, phishing links, scams
    * Adult content, religious or offensive content
    * Obvious attempts at harmful activities
    * Messages designed to deceive, harm, or mislead users
    * Messages containing 5 or more emoji with no meaningful text or context 
  - <likely-spam>: Suspicious but not clearly malicious content, such as:
    * External Telegram links without context (except links to the current chat or well-known resources like GitHub)
    * Vague job offers without sufficient details
    * Excessive self-promotion unrelated to the chat's primary topics
    * Borderline cases of self-promotion
    * Messages encouraging private communication without clear purpose
    * Excessive emojis in informal or promotional messages (3-5 emojis)
  - <not-spam>: Legitimate content such as:
    * Technical discussions and related questions
    * Code sharing and debugging help
    * Career advice, well-detailed job offers, or professional discussions
    * Links from recognized sources, trusted resources (e.g., GitHub, Stepik, YouTube, Habr)
    * General chat and on-topic discussions with reasonable use of emojis (1-3 emojis)
    * Informal or humorous messages without promotional or harmful intent
    * Links to the current chat without context
    * The command /subscription@VibeDatingBot in the "bogdanisssimo" chat (this is a trusted bot and should never be marked as spam)

  Notes:
  - Messages can be in Russian or English and may contain profanity
  - We encourage open discussions about different topics (e.g. technology, economics)
  - Some messages might lack context but should not be classified as spam unless harmful intent is evident
  - When in significant doubt, classify as "<not-spam>"
  - The command /subscription@VibeDatingBot is explicitly allowed in the "bogdanisssimo" chat and should never be marked as spam

  Detection Procedure:
  For <spam> or <likely-spam>: Provide 1-3 brief reasons (3-9 words each with short example in brackets), starting with "Reasons:\n"
  For <not-spam>: No reasons needed

  Input Data:
  - Message: """{message_text}"""

  Output Format:
  - <spam>, <likely-spam>, or <not-spam>
  - Reasons only if classified as <spam> or <likely-spam>
